# ECEM 2023 Arche ECS example

This repository contains an implementation of a simple individual-based grazing model.
The purpose of the model is to demonstrate the use of the Entity Component System (ECS) architecture in ecological modelling.

The model is provided as reference for my presentation on ECS at the European Conference on Ecological Modelling (ECEM) in Leipzig in September 2023.
